			<strong>Note:</strong> This is a simple script that isn't connected to any Natural Language Cognition networks. Whatever you type on the keyboard will be matched against the possible options given (dark grey bubbles). This script can't correct your spelling, it can't infer from synonyms or slang etc. But it is forgiving in terms of punctuation, capitalization and amount of text you type. For example, if one of the accepted answers is "Do 👉 this," you can simply type "do" and it'll work.
